## Library of packages

Phormal is a modular library. It aims to be feature rich, without bloating your bundled code. Therefore, you only need to install as much functionality as needed for your specific use-case. As a minimum, you will need to install the core package of the library:

```
npm install @phormal/core
```

## Further packages

The other packages of this library are divided into two categories. Packages which provide styling for the forms are named with a **theme-** prefix. Packages that add logic by hooking into different form fields, called **hooks**, are prefixed with **use-**, inspired by React naming conventions. Installation and usage instructions of these packages can be found under [Hooks](/api-docs/hooks) and [Themes](/api-docs/themes).
