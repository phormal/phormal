# Hooks

This library offers a way of *hooking* into the logic of the form fields. Below follows a list of all official hooks and their documentation. Please note, however, that you can also [write your own hooks](/api-docs/customization) if needed.

## Usage

All hooks are functions, that can take 0 or more arguments. They are returned within the `hooks` property of any form field, such as:

```js
const formFields = {
  name: {
    label: 'Name',
    hooks: [useAutoCapitalize(), useLength(2, 155), useRequired()]
  }
}
```

For more precise examples on how to use a hook, please refer to the code on [examples page](/guide/examples).


## List of hooks
### useAutoCapitalize

```bash copy
npm i @phormal/use-auto-capitalize
```

This hook will automatically capitalize the first letter of each word in the input value. The hook is not configurable.

### useEmail

```bash copy
npm i @phormal/use-email
```

This hook will validate that the input is a valid email address. The hook is not configurable.

### useLength

```bash copy
npm i @phormal/use-length
```

This hook can validate the minimum and maximum length on the input of a field.

|  Argument   |              Type               |             Description             |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| `minLength` | `number`, `undefined` or `null` | Set the minimum length of the input |
| `maxLength` | `number`, `undefined` or `null` | Set the maximum length of the input |

### useRequired

```bash copy
npm i @phormal/use-required
```

This hook will validate that the input is not empty. The hook is not configurable.

### useValidZip

```bash copy
npm i @phormal/use-valid-zip
```

This hook will validate that the format of a postal code matches the required format for a given country. The hook is not configurable, but requires 2 things to work properly:

1. It can only be used on a field of type `text`
2. It needs the presence of another field named `country`. This field needs a value that matches a valid country code, according to the ISO-3166 Alpha-2 standard: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/
