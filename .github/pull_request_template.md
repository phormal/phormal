| Element                                    | What to test                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Select element (basic and material themes) | Focus element before in tabindex, tab to select, and open options by pressing Space key or Enter key |
| Checkbox (only material theme)             | Check checkbox by clicking directly on it (as opposed to on its label)                               |
