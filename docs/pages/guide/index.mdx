## Library of packages

Phormal is a modular library. It aims to be feature rich, without bloating your bundled code. Therefore, you only need to install as much functionality as needed for your specific use-case. As a minimum, you will need to install the core package of the library:

```bash copy
npm install @phormal/core
```

## Further packages

The other packages of this library are divided into three categories.

* [Themes](/api-docs/themes) for adding CSS to your forms.
* [Hooks](/api-docs/hooks) for adding logic (such as validation) to your form fields.
* Components: for now the library only offers a dedicated component for Vue 3.
