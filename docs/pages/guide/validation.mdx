# Validating form input

For validating data, Phormal uses a concept called **hooks**. Instead of making a field required with `required: true`, or giving it a minimum- and maximum length through for example `{ minLength: 3, maxLength: 10 }`, we install hooks. This has one simple reason: this way we keep bundle sizes small. Instead of storing tons of translations for error messages in different languages in the core library, we install our validators one by one.

This way, you neither need to worry about writing validators, nor error messages yourself. Phormal does it for you, and provides multi-language error messages. All you need to do is install your validator, and [configure the language](/api-docs#config).

For example:

```js
import {Phormal} from "@phormal/core";
import useEmail from "@phormal/use-email";
import useRequired from "@phormal/use-required";
import useLength from "@phormal/use-length";

new Phormal(
  {
    name: {
      label: 'Name',
      hooks: [useRequired(), useLength(3)]
    },
    email: {
      label: 'Email',
      hooks: [useRequired(), useEmail()]
    }
  },
  {
    // ... other config
    language: 'es'
  }
)
```

would give you the following form. Try typing a little, to see the spanish translations of the error messages.

import DemoWithSpanish from "../../components/DemoWithSpanish";

<DemoWithSpanish />
