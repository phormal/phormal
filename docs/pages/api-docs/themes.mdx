# Themes

There are currently two available themes for the library. Both need to be installed separately in order to be used.

## Installation
```bash copy
npm install @phormal/theme-basic
```

or

```bash copy
npm install @phormal/theme-material
```

Examples of how they look can be found on the [examples page](/guide/examples).

## Importing

import {Tabs, Tab} from 'nextra-theme-docs';

<Tabs items={['basic', 'material']}>
	<Tab>
		```js copy
		import '@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css';
		```
	</Tab>

	<Tab>
		```js copy
		import '@phormal/theme-material/dist/index.css';
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

If you're using the `basic` theme, you are now all set up, since this is the default. For using the `material` theme, please enter the following into your configuration object:

```js
const config = {
  // .. other config
  theme: 'material'
}
```

For more on configuration of the form, please refer to the [configuration section](/api-docs#config).
