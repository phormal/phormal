# Tutorial of the basics

For this short tutorial, we will need the core package, as well as some packages for theme and validation:

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['JS', 'Vue 3']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @phormal/core @phormal/theme-basic @phormal/use-email @phormal/use-required @phormal/use-length
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @phormal/component-vue3 @phormal/theme-basic @phormal/use-email @phormal/use-required @phormal/use-length
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

We will create a form with three input fields. The **name** field will be a required field, and have a minimum length of 3 characters. The **email** field will also be required, and has to contain a valid email address. Lastly, there will be a checkbox for subscribing to a **newsletter**.

## Step 1: JavaScript

import Vanilla from '../../code-examples/getting-started/vanilla.mdx'
import Vue3 from '../../code-examples/getting-started/vue3.mdx'

<Tabs items={['JS', 'Vue 3']}>
  <Tab>
    <Vanilla />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Vue3 />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: HTML

<Tabs items={['JS', 'Vue 3']}>
  <Tab>
    In the configuration object, we have specified the element where the form should be rendered. Your HTML needs an element with the id `phormal`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    This is taken care of by the component itself. Move on to step 3!
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: CSS

<Tabs items={['JS', 'Vue 3']}>
  <Tab>
    The stylesheet for the basic theme is included in the `@phormal/theme-basic` package. The full path within the node_modules directory would be:

    ```
    '@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css'
    ```

    How you import this, will then of course vary, depending on the type of application that you are building.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    If importing the styles directly in a style tag, as in the example above, everythings is now set up. You can however, also import the stylesheet in your head-Tag. The full path within the node_modules directory would be:

    ```
    '@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css'
    ```


  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Result

import BasicDemo from "../../components/BasicDemo";

<BasicDemo />
