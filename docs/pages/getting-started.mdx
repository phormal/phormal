## Installation

Phormal is a modular library. It aims to be feature rich, without bloating your bundled code. Therefore, you only need to install as much functionality as needed for your specific use-case. As a minimum, you will need to install the core package of the library:

```
npm install @phormal/core
```

For this short tutorial, we will also install some packages for theme and validation:

```
npm install @phormal/core @phormal/theme-basic @phormal/use-email @phormal/use-required @phormal/use-length
```

## Basic example

In this basic example, we will create a form with two input fields. The **name** field will be a required field, and have a minimum length of 3 characters. The **email** field will also be required, and has to contain a valid email address.

### Step 1: JavaScript

```
import { Phormal } from '@phormal/core';

const form = new Phormal({
    name: {
      label: 'Name',
      hooks: [useRequired(), useLength(3)],
    },
    email: {
      label: 'Email',
      hooks: [useRequired(), useEmail()],
    },
  }, {
    el: '#phormal',
    theme: 'basic',
  })

form.init()
```

### Step 2: HTML

In the configuration object, we have specified the element where the form should be rendered. Your HTML needs an element with the id `phormal`.

### Step 3: CSS

The stylesheet for the basic theme is included in the `@phormal/theme-basic` package. The full path within the node_modules directory would be:

```
'@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css'
```

How you import this, will then of course vary, depending on the type of application that you are building.

## Result

import BasicDemo from "../components/BasicDemo";

<BasicDemo />
