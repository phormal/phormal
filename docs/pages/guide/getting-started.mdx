## Tutorial of the basics

For this short tutorial, we will need the core package, as well as some packages for theme and validation:

```
npm install @phormal/core @phormal/theme-basic @phormal/use-email @phormal/use-required @phormal/use-length
```

We will create a form with three input fields. The **name** field will be a required field, and have a minimum length of 3 characters. The **email** field will also be required, and has to contain a valid email address. Lastly, there will be a checkbox for subscribing to a newsletter.

### Step 1: JavaScript

```js
import { Phormal } from '@phormal/core';
import useEmail from "@phormal/use-email";
import useRequired from "@phormal/use-required";
import useLength from "@phormal/use-length";

const formFields = {
  name: {
    label: 'Name',
    hooks: [useRequired(), useLength(3)]
  },
  email: {
    label: 'Email',
    hooks: [useRequired(), useEmail()]
  },
  newsletter: {
    type: 'checkbox',
    label: 'Newsletter',
    value: true
  }
}

const formConfig = { el: '#phormal', theme: 'basic' }

const form = new Phormal(formFields, formConfig)
```

### Step 2: HTML

In the configuration object, we have specified the element where the form should be rendered. Your HTML needs an element with the id `phormal`.

### Step 3: CSS

The stylesheet for the basic theme is included in the `@phormal/theme-basic` package. The full path within the node_modules directory would be:

```
'@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css'
```

How you import this, will then of course vary, depending on the type of application that you are building.

## Result

import BasicDemo from "../../components/BasicDemo";

<BasicDemo />
